* FELICS reminder
** platforms
- AVR, MSP: simulated
- ARM, PC: measured
** metrics
- code size
- RAM
- execution time
** distribution
- code + setup
- VM
** cipher integration
- API
- encryption/decryption split
- type annotations to indicate memory placement


* Changes to get to FELICS-AE
** crypto_aead API
with changes:
- remove unused nsec
- unsigned long long â‡’ size_t
** PC cycle jitter mitigation
** scenario simplification
** key schedule removal
** Python scripts
** Docker image
** output format (JSON)


* Usage (setup, APIs, user guide)


* Results with Lilliput-AE, Ascon, ACORN


* Future work
** add other LWC candidates
** simplify platform addition
right now, changes are needed all over the place:
- measurements shell scripts
- makefile
- headers
** add scenarios back
perhaps simply as a couple of parameters for plaintext/AD length?
** allow multiple test vectors
** add profiling
e.g. to get some data on the key schedule's contribution
** simplify algorithm addition
- stop requiring encryption/decryption split; add symbols whose code
  size must be subtracted to metadata file
