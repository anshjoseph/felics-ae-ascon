\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The CAESAR competition~\cite{CAESAR:submissions} and the NIST
Lightweight Cryptography Standardization Process~\cite{NIST:LWC} have
brought to light several new authenticated encryption schemes
dedicated to ``lightweight'' use-cases.  In these use-cases, target
devices are strongly constrained in terms of computing resources: they
have limited volatile memory (RAM) and non-volatile memory (ROM),
their processors operate at low frequencies and feature few registers,
they may only be able to draw power from a battery that can neither be
recharged nor replaced, etc.

These devices thus have very few resources to spare on security.  This
implies that the aforementioned algorithms must be selected not only
for their robustness, but also according to their efficiency.  Given
two encryption schemes with equivalent security, the scheme which
leaves the target device more resources to perform its designed
function should be preferred.

Thus measuring the performance of these algorithms is an integral part
of the selection process carried out in~\cite{NIST:LWC}.  In this
paper, we present FELICS-AE, an adaptation of the FELICS
framework~\cite{FELICS:paper} dedicated to authenticated encryption
schemes, which we use to assess the performance of our candidate
\textsc{Lilliput-AE}~\cite{NIST:Lilliput-AE}.

First, in section~\ref{sec:background}, we will present the original
FELICS framework.  We will then present FELICS-AE in
section~\ref{sec:felics-ae}, going over our work to adapt the
framework and explaining how to set it up, measure algorithm
performance, and add new encryption schemes.  We will present the
results we obtained so far in section~\ref{sec:results}.  To conclude,
we will mention possible improvements for FELICS-AE in
section~\ref{sec:future}.
